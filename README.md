# FantasticFoods
A web application that is related with ordering food online.

This commit of the project FantasticFoods allows for the following features:

1. User can select from a list of 10 food items (using checkboxes), specify their quantity and order.
2. 10 different unique IDs allow these users (possibly various vendors) to view the orders in their respective category
(eg.., sandwich vendor, pizza vendor,etc) and redirects them to their respective pages.
3. Javascript Validations are used on the order page.

Features that would be included in the future commits:
Inclusion of an Admin Panel to add,modify, update the vendors.
